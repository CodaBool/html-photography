					<h1>THE DETAILS</h1>
					<ul class="flex-container">
					  <li class="flex-details2"><p>Getting that perfect image which can illustrate a whole memory is what makes it all worth it for me. I love working with people to deliver an album which they can keep forever. Photographs can tell an entire story. Changing your mood and provoking memories which can be very powerful. I know that I have such photos in my collection which can make me laugh and smile.<br><br> I would love to become a part of that experience for you. An important part of photography is the collaboration. My work is never passive and will need to work together to make something great. In order for a photo to deliver on all aspects, we need to create an energy of creativity. <br><br>When working with people I like to become your friend and help find exactly what it is you would like to see. This is about the story you want to tell and I am happy to be a part of that. Everyone has their own unique way of finding and telling that story. Together we can create that energy and capture it through images. <br> <br></p>
					  <li class="flex-details2"><p>The details of your story are important and I want to make sure everything is communicated and can be delivered back to you in my images. When approaching a project in this perspective I find it works to deliver something which everyone can enjoy for a lifetime.<br><br> This is why I find my work so important and cannot wait to begin collaboration with you!<br><br>My porfolio work is just beginning but I already have images which I am very proud of. I have been taking photos for family events for years. I have three brothers who are all married and have children. My family trusts me to capture their events, be it baby photos, wedding photos, or group photos.<br><br>I would love to share that same passion I have for capturing my family and applying it to events within your family. Together we can create a photo album which can be used forever and will honor your memory of any occasion. Your event is important and I cannot wait to become a part of it!	</p></li>

					<h2 id="cursive_heading">Frequently Asked</h2>
					<ul class="flex-container">
					  <li class="flex-details3"><h1>WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT AS PHOTOGRAPHERS?</h1><p><br>What makes me unique as a photographer is my genuine passion for the craft. Many people look at photography as a business where a client should go through steps to get a result. I like to look at each event as a story and work from there. This means capturing the emotion. I look at each project as unique and every individual's needs as important. This is can be a difficult but rewarding process. </p></li>
					  <li class="flex-details3"><h1>WHAT IS YOUR STYLE OF PHOTOGRAPHY? </h1><p><br>My style is to work with everyone as family. I approach each of my projects fresh, wanting to know exactly what story you would like to tell with my photos. I will provide as many ideas as I can but am still open to try new ones. I want to open up a creative atmosphere where I can really see you as a friend. Once that happens the work becomes easy and fun. I find this produces in the best photos and also makes for an enjoyable experience.</p></li>
					  <li class="flex-details3"><h1>DO YOU MAKE US POSE A LOT?</h1><p><br>I approach every project as different. This means that I apply my old knowledge and try and account for everything new. Meaning there will be poses, however, I like to work with ideas freeflowing. It's a rule for me to not have generic rigid poses. Everyone has a different body and I try to accentuate features in a natural way for each person. So, I am making poses happen dynamically and can work with each individual to create a personalized story.</p></li>
