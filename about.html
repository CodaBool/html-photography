				  <p>I am Coda Bool, I am a student at University of Central Florida. I have always had a passion for photography. I shoot all events and would love to help you get that perfect album for your next occasion.</p><br><p> I have been collecting camera gear and as many tools as I can get. These tools help me with every project. Many parts like camera sliders and light reflectors help to make video or make a great shot even better. Combining good photography with powerful software like Photoshop allow me to create lasting images.</p><br><p> Photographs can tell an entire story. Changing your mood and provoking memories which can be very powerful. I would love to become a part of that experience for you. An important part of photography is the collaboration. When working with people I like to become your friend and help find exactly what it is you would like to see. This is about the story you want to tell and I am happy to be a part of that.  The details of your story are important and I want to make sure everything is communicated and can be delivered back to you in my images. When approaching a project in this perspective I find it works to deliver something which everyone can enjoy for a lifetime. This is why I find my work so important and cannot wait to begin collaboration with you!</p><br><p> My porfolio work is just beginning but I already have images which I am very proud of. I have been taking photos for family events for years. I have three brothers who are all married and have children. My family trusts me to capture their events, be it baby photos, wedding photos, or group family photography. I would love to share that same passion I have for capturing my family and applying it to events within your family. Together we can create a photo album which can be used forever and will honor your memory of any occasion. Your event is important and I cannot wait to become a part of it!</p></li>
